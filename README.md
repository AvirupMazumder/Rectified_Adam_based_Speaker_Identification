# About the Codes
In this repository you will find 3 codes; **models.py**,**cfg6.py** **and** **predict.py**. In models.py we are doing feature extraction through MFCC and fitting it in CNN and LSTM. In cfg6.py, we are storing some pre determined values such as sampling rate, number of filters, hopping rate and nffts. We are passing it to models.py through a class Config stored in cfg6.py. In predict.py we are predicting the values of our speaker identifications and storing it in the form of a .csv file.
